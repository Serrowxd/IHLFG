# IHLFG

I hate LFG!

# Notes

Rather than pulling directly from the API when searching for the player information - search dynamically when updating the character profile, then save the information to a database.

Cuts down on load times & gives a local resource to pull from.

# To-Do

- Reactivity
- Search Page & 404 (can be same container, different component rendered)
- User Account Pages (User & Logged-in Owner of Profile)
